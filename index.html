            <h2 class="about__section">Internet Technologies and Its impacts in daily life</h2>
            <p>The ability of the Internet to transfer information and data via various servers and networks is referred to as Internet technology. Internet technology is significant in a variety of businesses because it allows individuals to connect with one another in ways that were previously unavailable.The Internet is basically a massive database from which all kinds of material can be passed and transmitted. It may be moved around passively in the form of non-interactive websites and blogs, or actively in the form of file sharing and document launching. Internet technology has resulted in a wealth of knowledge being accessible to those with Internet access.People who were used to textbooks and libraries will now read everything they want from the convenience of their computer.  Internet technology is rapidly evolving and has the potential to advance the huge expansion that it has developed.With the technology that run the Internet, speeds are quicker, more information is available, and many procedures that were before impossible are now accessible. The way the world does business and how people communicate in real life has changed and will continue to evolve as a result of internet technologies.<br>
            There are may impacts on Internet technology in our daily life. Some of the positive and negative impacts are described below:
            The internet has certainly made studying so much simpler that one may no longer need to be in a classroom to take lessons. Another advantageous effect is the availability of writing tools for improved writing.Applications such as plagiarism checkers, dictionaries, and spell checkers have provided students a variety of possibilities, and the best part is that some of these applications are available in offline mode. There is little question that if a student had access to these resources, he or she would submit a work efficiently.The last one is Student Collaborations. The internet has enabled many students all around the world to interact, collaborate, and enhance their writings. To think about it, a student from Kenya can collaborate with a student from Japan, both of whom have distinct cultures and backgrounds, and working on an essay together would almost surely result in a better essay than if one of them handled the assignment alone.
            Plagiarism also has a negative impact. With so much information available online and easily accessible, some students may just duplicate a previously written essay or a significant section of it and pretend as the writers.<br>
                Sometimes with the belief that the examiners would not notice or check this.The other is a decrease in originality, an over-reliance on the internet for information, and all of this would result in a loss of originality from the students. Some writers believe that young writers nowadays lack imagination since their writing is so similar to each other since they all draw from the same sources.The final one is poor writing. When we write, we might occasionally employ online language and abbreviated forms to enhance communication. Students may forget that they are writing an essay that should have some level of formality, and their writing may contain so much slang that the quality of the writing suffers as a result.</p>
